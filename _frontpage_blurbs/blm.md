We are deeply disheartened and hurt by the blatant acts of racism and injustice happening both here in our home state of Georgia, and on a national level.
HackGT stands against racism towards the Black community, and supports those against racism in all forms. Silence speaks loudly, and we cannot claim to believe in our values if we do not speak up and support others when it matters the most.

In order to continue creating a future in education and technology that is accessible to ALL, we must take the time to listen and to educate ourselves. Our actions must include working alongside the communities we aim to serve, and reinforcing our commitment to education initiatives in the Atlanta area.
To see some of the actions we are taking, and to get involved, please visit our Facebook at facebook.com/thehackgt

**We are here for you, we hear you, and we support you. We will continue to fight for a future that is inclusive and just for all.**
