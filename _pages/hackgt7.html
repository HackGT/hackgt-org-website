                What is a hackathon?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Hackathons are 36-hour events where students from across the country come together 
                for a weekend to create anything that shows off their creativity and passion for 
                development. You may choose any platform, programming language, or format to show 
                how you re-imagine solutions. 
            </p>

                limited due to building capacity and travel reimbursement budgets, so this year

                How does a virtual hackathon work?
            </h3>
            <p>
                The same as an in-person one, with just a few tweaks! While we won't all be able to 
                hack away in Klaus Advanced Computing Building this year, we'll still get to have 
                all things that make hackathons great. This means the opportunity to network with 
                sponsors, attend mini events, learn from a large range of workshops, and compete 
                for prizes! Plus, with moving to an online format, we'll be allocating our resources 
                to things such as a larger prizes and an enhanced mentor experience. We've got a lot 
                in store!

            <h3>
                Why did HackGT go virtual?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Due to recent health concerns surrounding Coronavirus (COVID-19), HackGT has made the 
                decision to move all our fall events to an online format for the health and safety of 
                our participants and team members.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide hardware this year. If you have access to 
                hardware and would like to use it in your project, hardware submissions are more than 
                welcome! If not, we'll be offering lots of other online resources and can't wait to see 
                what you come up with!
