                HackGT is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and student organization consisting of Georgia Tech undergraduate students focused on being the drivers of computer science outreach in the Georgia Tech, state, and national communities. Through throwing large-scale collegiate hackathons of upwards of 1000 people to small-scale hackathons and workshops, our organization aims to spread the spirit of application, innovation, and creativity in computer science education.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                By partnering with companies and organizations large and small, we are able to cultivate environments that bring value to the lives of the communities we serve all at no cost to the participants. The motivation behind throwing free events is to allow for any person of any background to have the capacity to take full advantage of a positive experience. Our organization strives to provide a resource-rich environment that ultimately ends up in allowing a participant to learn and apply new skills, connect with other like-minded innovate individuals, and bring any of their ideas to life.
