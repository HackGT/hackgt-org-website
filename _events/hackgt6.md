HackGT's 6th annual installment of our marquee 1000 person, 36-hour collegiate hackathon! In 2019, participants went on an adventure Into the Rabbit Hole to Wonderland. Wonderland is a place with the most unexpected of things. Follow Beardell on a 36-hour adventure as his world gets turned upside down! As participants explored Wonderland, they encountered wild characters, used fantastical technology, and even create the impossible.
