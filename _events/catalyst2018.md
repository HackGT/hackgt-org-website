For our second iteration of Catalyst, we hosted a day of STEAM exposure for more than 150 high school students from the Atlanta area. Students were able to pick from three curriculum tracks: design, development, and hardware. Throughout the day, participants explored their track with the help of specialized mentors, interactive workshops, and guided projects.
