HackGTâ€™s 5th annual installment of our marquee 1000 person, 36-hour collegiate hackathon! In 2017, we helped participants reach New Heights, but this year we wanted to try something different. Specifically, Dare to Venture with our participants into the unknown. Inspired by the lush greenery of the Pacific Northwest, we organized a myriad of workshops, fireside chats, and mini-events in an effort to empower participants to learn something new and have fun in the process.
